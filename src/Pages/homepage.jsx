          is Jyoti Prakash Mohapatra and I am a MERN Stack Developer, passionate
          about building digital products that improve everyday experience for
          people. I love to work on exciting projects that test what I've
          learnt, whilst being exposed to the power and potential of the
          ever-evolving technologies around us. I'm always looking for better,
          and more importantly, ethical and accessible ways to solve the common
          problems we are faced with day-to-day life.
